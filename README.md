This repository provies the data and code that is required to investigate the results of our investigations. It contains a script that enables you to locally run a dash app, which you can use in your browser:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open your terminal and go to the directory "Optimal_Control_GUI"
3. Install all required packages by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Go to the sub-directory "Optimal_Control_GUI/GUI"
5. Run the python script "gui.py"
6. You will be prompted an url (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050/), which you can either click or copy-paste into your browser to open the app.
7. Have fun exploring the results!
