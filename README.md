# Optimal_Control_GUI
This repository provies the data and code that is required to investigate the results of our investigations. It contains a script that enables you to locally run a dash app, which you can use in your browser:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open your terminal and go to the sub-directory "Optimal_Control_GUI/GUI"
3. Run the python script "gui.py"
4. You will be prompted an url (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050/), which you can either click or copy-paste into your browser to open the app.
5. Have fun exploring the results!
6. If you have any questions or encounter any (technical) problems, do not hesitate to contact me: lena.salfenmoser@tu-berlin.de
